- Vocabulary to describe **why**

]


???

I guess the other parts of my motivation for this talk come from seeing a lot of people using bad/sub optimal colourscales. 

There is great tooling in R to do the following:

---

# We're going in for a deep dive here, folks

```{r deep-dive-gif}
include_graphics("https://gifs.njtierney.com/whistling-deep-dive.gif")
```

# Goals of this talk

- What is colour?
- How do we perceive colour?
- What is colourblindness?
- What is a vocabulary around colour?
- How do I use colour in my plot?
- How do I assess colour?
- How do I create new colour palettes?

???

This made sense to me, I know what colourblindness is, and I know what perceptually uniform means.

But I also have an honours degree in Psychological Science. My honours project studied the human visual system, in an area called psychophysics. I didn’t study colour, but we did need to learn about the visual system in neuropsychology.


# What is colour?

Disclaimer: This is a _brief_ introduction into a **complex** topic

This next section is inspired by [Calder Hansen's ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7zwxzcgdrjnFkRrLnfN_CA) [The Science of Color Perception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poL7nDmqjmk)

# Colour: Waves of light, perceived.


Just as there are soundwaves that you can hear `r emo::ji("sound")` `r emo::ji("ear")`

There are lightwaves that we see `r emo::ji("light")` `r emo::ji("eyes")`

???

This combines physics, biology, and a bit of philosophy. 

---
# Physics of Colour

These lightwaves come in different shapes - different wavelengths:

```{r wavelengths, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("imgs/wave-sml-trim.png")
```


---
# The visible spectrum

```{r show-spectra}
gg_colour_spectra(cone_response)
```


???

- At this end we have the longest wavelengths
- At this end we have the shortest wavelengths

# Physics of Colour (More than we can see)

- Note that this is just a tiny slice of the light spectrum
- We just happen to be able to see this range of colours
- But How?

---
# Physics of Colour

```{r eyes-cones, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("imgs/eye-cones-trim.png")
```


???

- Lightwaves enter our eyes, and we have the perception of colour.
  - Shorter wavelengths = "purple" / "blue
  - longer wavelengths = "red"
  
- As light enters the eye, it hits cells that are sensitive to light. 
- These cells are called rods and cones. 
- The cones are the bits that allow us to see colour

---
# Biology of colour: cones

```{r show-cones, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("imgs/cone-family-trim.png")
```
  
???
  
- If we get only one type of colour entering in the eye, we get one colour.
- This is because of these three cones:
- Colours are brighter when there is more of the light
- most colours are a combination of multiple wave lengths

  
---
# Biology of colour: cone sensitivty to light

```{r cone-sensitivity}
cone_response %>% gg_cone_receptor()
```

.small[Image inspired by [figure of responsivity of human eye from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg), data extracted from [Colour & Vision Research laboratory at UCL's](http://cvrl.ucl.ac.uk) section on [cones](http://cvrl.ucl.ac.uk/cones.htm).]



---
# How do we see colour? Blue?

```{r perception, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("imgs/perception-trim.png")
```


???

So what happens when we are exposed to a lot of these longer wavelengths of "red" light?

- Long cones react
- Medium cones not so much
- S cones not at all

That information is then taken in to your brain and then you have the sensation of "red".

---
# But I don't just see red and green and blue?

Well, kinda?

```{r rgb-spec}
gplots::col2hex(c("red", "green", "blue")) %>% specplot(rgb = TRUE,
                                                        hcl = FALSE)
```

---
# But I don't just see red and green and blue?

Well, kinda?

```{r rgb-spec-extra-again}
gplots::col2hex(c("red", "pink",
                  "green", "greenyellow",
                  "blue", "skyblue")) %>% 
  specplot(rgb = TRUE,
           hcl = FALSE)
```


???

- Colour is made up of the _combination_ of light entering our eye.
- Red could be some of ..., and some of ...
- Orange could be
- White could be all colours, or it could just be 

There are actually many different combinations of light waves that can get us to see different colours.

This means that colour is not just a single light waves, or a combination of many, but it is our perception of light

---
# Colourblindness

- What happens if someone doesn't have some of these cones?

- Or one of the cones isn't as responsive?

- This is what we call **colourblindness** and **colourweakness**

- Depending on which cones are missing, this means some sets of colours are indistinguishable from one another. 

- It affects up to 10% of males of European descent, and 1 in 200 women.

# Colourblindness key points

- We perceive colour using the cones in our eyes
- Some people don't have certain cones, or reduced capacity in those
- This means some colours cannot be distinguished by those with colourblindness
- We need to be careful how we present colour, and what colours we present.

---
# Tools for testing how well your plot stands up to colourblindness?

- We can transform colours into approximations of colourblindness
- Many tools exist for exploring colourblindness
- We'll mostly be exploring the R package, `colorspace`

---
# Tools for testing how well your plot stands up to colourblindness?

- `colorspace`: `protan()`, `deutan()`, `tritan()` transform colours.

```{r show-protan, echo = TRUE}
# Just rainbow
rainbow(5) 
# Rainbow into protan
rainbow(5) %>% protan()
```

# How to test how well your plot stands up to colourblindness?

```{r show-protan-swatch, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 4}
rainbow(19) %>% protan() %>% swatchplot()
```


---
# How to test how well your plot stands up to colourblindness?

.left-code[
The `prismatic` package provides `check_color_blindness`:

  check_color_blindness()

```{r prismatic-check-out, ref.label = 'prismatic-check', echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.height = 8}

---
# What if your plot is an image already?

- `colorspace` provides a "Colour Vision Deficiency (CVD) Emulator" - `cvd_emulator`.
- This takes in a JPG / PNG
- Let's explore what this original image from BoM looks like:

```r

These go by other names, and are just one of a set of many different colour representations (HSV, CIELAB, … ), and the literature on colourspace is wide and vast. These allow us to explore and explain colour in a way that makes sense to human.

These are human readable ways to describe colour, but ultimately get expressed into terms of RGB.

- Diverging: Designed for coding numeric information around a central neutral value, i.e., where colors diverge from neutral to two extremes.

# Tools for exploring colourblindness:

- Using the hex/colour codes
  - Colorspace: `protan`/`deutan`/`tritan`
  - prismatic: `check_color_blindness`
- For a ggplot object
  - colorblindr: `cvd_grid`
- For an image
  - colorspace: `cvd_emulator`

---
# Tools for creating good colours

- Colorspace: 
 - `qualitative_hcl`
 - `sequential_hcl`
 - `diverging_hcl`
- Pick the hue/chroma/luminance you want to travel through

# A workflow for choosing a colour palette

1. What type of data is it?
2. Decide the colour palette type: 
  - Qualitative: Are the categories equal?
  - Sequential: Does the value go from low to high?
  - Diverging: Does it have a natural balance/zero point?
1. Check colourblindness: `check_color_blindness`
1. Explore colour with `specplot` (combine with `protan` and friends)
1. Explore how it looks with `demoplot`  (combine with `protan` and friends)

# Take homes

- Colour choice matters
- Choosing colours is hard
- We can use Hue / Chroma / Luminance to describe colour
- See established palettes: colorspace / viridis / scico
- Assess colours with `colorspace::specplot()`
- Assess colourblindness with `colorspace::cvd_emulator()`
- Evaluate your own colour palettes at `hclwizard.com`
- Choose colour palettes with 
  - `colorspace::choose_palette()`
  - `colorspace::choose_color()`
  - `colorspace::hcl_color_picker()`
  - `colorspace::hcl_wizard()`
