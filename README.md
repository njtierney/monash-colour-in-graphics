# Bio

Dr. Nicholas Tierney (PhD. Statistics, BPsySci (Honours)) is a Lecturer in Business Analytics and Statistics at Monash University, working with Professors
[Dianne Cook](http://dicook.org/) and [Rob Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/). His research aims to improve data analysis
workflow, and make data analysis more accessible. Crucial to this work is producing high quality software to
accompany each research idea. Mostly recently, Nick's work is focussing on exploring longitudinal data ([brolgar](http://brolgar.njtierney.com/)), and improving how we share data alongside research ( [ddd](https://github.com/karthik/ddd)). Other work has focussed on exploring data
with the R package [visdat](http://visdat.njtierney.com/), and on creating analysis principles and tools
to simplify working with, exploring, and modelling missing data with the
package [naniar](http://naniar.njtierney.com/). Nick has experience working with decision trees ([treezy](http://treezy.njtierney.com/)),
optimisation ([maxcovr](http://maxcovr.njtierney.com/)), Bayesian Data Analysis, and MCMC diagnostics ([mmcc](http://mmcc.njtierney.com/).

Nick is a member of the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) collective, which works to make science
open using R, has been the lead organiser for the rOpenSci ozunconf
events from 2016-2018 ([2016](https://auunconf.ropensci.org/), [2017](https://ozunconf17.ropensci.org/), [2018](https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/)), and co-hosts the rstats podcast ["Credibly
Curious"](https://soundcloud.com/crediblycurious) with [Dr. Saskia Freytag](https://careers.amsi.org.au/saskia/). Outside of research, Nick likes to
hike, rockclimb, make coffee, bake sourdough, (eventually) knit a hat, take photos, and explore new hobbies.
